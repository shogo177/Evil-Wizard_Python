====================================

📖 ABOUT THE GAME
-----------------
This is a simple turn-based battle game built with Python.  
You create a hero character and face off against the Evil Wizard.  
The game demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts 
such as inheritance, methods, and interactions between objects.

⚔️ FEATURES
------------
- Four playable hero classes:
  1. Warrior – High health and strong melee attacks.
  2. Mage – Powerful magic with high damage.
  3. Archer – Quick attacks and evasion abilities.
  4. Paladin – Defensive fighter with healing and shielding powers.

- Each class has 2 unique special abilities.
- Healing mechanic restores health without exceeding maximum.
- Randomized attack damage for more dynamic gameplay.
- The Evil Wizard regenerates health each turn and strikes back.
- Victory/Defeat messages when the battle ends.
- Interactive menu system:
  1. Attack
  2. Use Special Ability
  3. Heal
  4. View Stats (shows both player and wizard stats at the end of turn)

🖥️ HOW TO PLAY
---------------
1. Run the script in Python 3:
   > python main.py

2. Choose your character class and enter your hero's name.
3. During battle, select actions from the menu:

🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES
-----------------------
- Practice Python OOP principles (inheritance, methods, polymorphism).
- Implement a turn-based battle loop.
- Work with randomized outcomes and decision-based gameplay.
- Build and organize a small but complete interactive program.
